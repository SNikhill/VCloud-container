**Guided by:** Aakash Tangri

## Problem
Smart boards in our school were inter-connected using a Local Network and used "old school" folder sharing to share content.
There was no option to search the content, sort the videos or an easy way to save to watch it later on.

## Solution
[VCloud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MugZcvFh4Y). It is an elegant, _in house_ made Web Interface meant to run on a local network that provides an easy and customised approach to all the uploaded videos with a very easy Search. [Features](#features).
